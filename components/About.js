			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<p>
				I am a full stack dev with a penchant for knowledge and a drive to learn new things. I am highly adapatable and believe that my past experiences have taught me how to process concepts into layman terms so that I can better help others to understand things. My goal is to continue to hone my craft and further my own skills so that I may better impact the industry.
