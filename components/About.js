				<p>
					I can clean your webcode! Let me help your sites load fast, secure, and easier for any engineer to work on your front-end and back-end. As a growth minded developer, I will be responsive to the requirements of projects.
					<br/>
					<br/>
					My current strengths focus on full stack web engineering, but learning new languages is a great opportunity to grow alongside your projects.
					<br/>
					<br/>
					With a background in sales and construction, I am comfortable delivering web product knowledge to roles of all levels. I add value to diverse teams by ensuring visibility and education of newly implemented web tools.
